The environmental impacts of game development are minimal compared to heavy industry.

The main resource consumed is electrical power. This could be offset by using solar power on site for a large company.


Some potential WHS concerns with game development are:
 - RSI from using a mouse and keyboard for prolonged periods of time
 - Back problems from bad posutre
 - Stress, fatigue and other psychological symptoms from crunch time culture.
 - Eye strain from staring at a screen for a prolonged period of time.
